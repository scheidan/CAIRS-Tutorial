# Date description

The data are from a real measurement camping in Switzerland.
However, the coordinates are changed.

All files contain time stamps and all measurements are rain
intensities in mm/h.

## Rain gauges (stations)

Measure the rain intensity at one point:

Station2.csv: 2085 / 3498
Station2.csv: 2389 / 2191
Station2.csv: 3044 / 2718
Station4.csv: 1447 / 2924
Station5.csv: 2125 / 989


## Micro Wave Links (MWL)

Measure the _average_ rain intensity along a path:

link1.csv: (700 / 2710) to (3292 /  4252)
link2.csv: (700 / 2710) to (1190 /  4828)
link3.csv: (700 / 2710) to (4737 / -2148)


## Radar

The radar measures the _average_ intensity with a pixel. Each pixel
has a extent of 1000m x 1000m.

The position is defined by the file name: "Radar_xxxx_yyyy.csv" where
xxxx and yyyy are the coordinates in m of the bottom left corner of a pixel.
